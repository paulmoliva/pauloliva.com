			<h2>
				Who am I?
			</h2>
			
				
				
			
						
			
			<p>
				My name is Myranda Walso. I am a first time candidate for public office. As a mother,
				
				entrepreneur, and lifelong Alaskan, I believe my particular skill set will be an asset to the state. I 
				
				understand numbers, budgets, and financial statements. As a citizen, I emphasize the importance 
				
				of financial responsibility. I have learned to listen well and communicate clearly. I know what it 
				
				takes to transform complex issues into practical solutions. I think “outside the box” and offer 
				
				proactive approaches with a positive attitude.

			<h2><a name="why"></a>
				Why I'm Running
			</h2>

				
				
			<p>
								Alaska is my home, and I recognize we face trying times. Unsustainable divergence 
				
				between revenue and spending levels force us to reconsider the size, structure, and role of 
				
				government. The ramifications of this election will be felt most acutely by those in my 
				
				generation, and our families. My children are fifth generation Alaskans, and I hope they have the 
				
				same security and opportunities I enjoyed growing up. I believe wholeheartedly in the future of 
				
				Alaska, but I won’t ignore the present or forget the past. The answer to the current crises cannot 
				
				be found by doing more of the same.
			</p>
			
			<p>
								A new solution requires new leaders. It is quite common to have representatives who
				
				have been in politics for many years, and our neighborhood is no different. I believe we need 
				
				new leadership and direction. I am running because to ensure the people have a choice; the 
				
				option to see a new face, with a new perspective, representing them in the Legislature.
			</p>
			<p>
								Having never run for or held public office before, this decision was heartfelt and 
				
				important to me. Involvement in local governance is essential, because the decisions made and 
				
				actions taken have enormous impact on our everyday lives. I take very seriously the 
				
				responsibility inherent in public service, and I want to utilize my knowledge, experience, and 
				
				ability on behalf of the residents of Chugiak/Eagle River in the State Legislature and ask for your 
				
				vote. I am ready for this new challenge, and with your help, on August 16, 2016 we can start 
				
				making a difference together.
			</p>
