			<h2>
				On the Issues
			</h2>
			<p>The election of a legislature in 2016 may well be the most important decision Alaska will make during the rest of the decade. Our future as a state is at stake. We cannot condone any longer the perpetual budget gridlock, rampant mismanagement of public funds, and the loss of confidence that so defines recent political conflicts. We must stop the decline of leadership, reverse any weakening of our communal security, and put an end to aimlessly drifting from crisis to crisis. 
			</p>
			<p>The Alaska Constitution states, “All political power is inherent in the people. All government originates with the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the people as a whole.” The people of Alaska have a long history of coming together to achieve great things. Our government needs to reflect this principle. We can solve our problems. We can do it with Alaska determination, spirit, and strength of purpose. But we must have leadership that listens to the Alaskan people. We must have a legislature that has the needs of all Alaskans in mind, looking to the future of our neighborhoods. Alaskans don’t expect government to solve every issue. But they do know that when times are tough we must work together; Alaska can move forward only when we do so together. The responsibility of putting Alaska on the path to sustained growth and security remains a task we all share equally. 
			
			<a name="fiscal"></a><h3>Fiscal Responsibility</h3> 
			<p>
								Our neighborhoods represent so much of how our families experience life in Alaska. It is 
				
				imperative for our government to continue investing in local communities. This means 
				
				responsible infrastructure construction and maintenance, robust economic development, ongoing 
				
				public health and safety programs, and increased respect for public process.</p>
				
			<p>
								The State of Alaska held about $15.6 billion combined in its Constitutional Budget Reserve and
				
				Statutory Budget Reserve funds at the beginning of the July 1, 2014 fiscal year. Because 
				
				forecasting revenues relies so much on hard to predict oil prices, models vary. However, most 
				
				experts agree the state will completely drain all available savings accounts far short of 2020 on 
				
				the current spending and revenue paths.
			</p>
			
			<p>
								The current series of stalled budget talks and special sessions are a disaster, because the 
				
				fundamental problem remains: government continues to spend billions of dollars more than it 
				
				takes in. We have been caught in a cycle where spending has no correlation to revenue. Tax and 
				
				Spending cuts must always go together. A tax cut without a commensurate cut in spending keeps Big Government big. Likewise, an increase in spending requires an increase in revenue. We
				
				can’t spend money we don’t have. People will have to decide what level and breadth of service 
				
				we expect from our government, and prioritize accordingly.
			</p>
			<a name="transparency"></a><h3>Transparency</h3>
			<p>There is a fundamental disconnect between how our leaders make decisions and the public process. This must end. Government owes accountability to the people. Citizens shouldn’t have to be a CPA or a trained business auditor to follow money around in government. Taxpayers shouldn’t need a court order or the Freedom of Information Act to see how every penny of their money is being spent. We must act now to reduce the power of special interests and make government more democratic. Increased transparency and public involvement in the processes of governance is the first step toward reducing and removing government waste. 
			
			<a name="community"></a><h3>Community</h3>
			<p>Our neighborhoods represent so much of how our families experience life in Alaska. It is imperative for our government to continue investing in local communities. This means responsible infrastructure construction and maintenance, robust economic development, ongoing public health and safety programs, and increased respect for public process.
			
			<a name="education"></a><h3>Education</h3>
					<p>Alaska has one of the highest costs per student in the country. Yet, many of our students 
					
					continue to underperform academically. Through the dedication of parents, teachers, students, 
					
					and others in the community I feel we have made incredible strides towards improvement. The 
					
					need is still great and continues to grow.  Declining state revenues force us to closely examine 
					
					every dollar of the budget, and education claims nearly a quarter of the operating budget.
					
					The general fund portion of the Department of Education and Early Development (DEED) is up 
					
					nearly 58% from 2006. Yet, the Base Student Allocation, the formula by which schools are 
					
					funded per student, has barely kept up with inflation over that period; it increased 15% from 
					
					fiscal year 2006 to 2014. Interestingly, while the overall education budget has grown drastically, 
					
					the number of K-12 public school students has been decreasing. During the 2005-2006 school 
					
					year, approximately 131,000 students attended public school in Alaska. By fall of 2014, that 
					
					number was down to 128,800.  </p>
					
					<p>The future of Alaska begins with our children. For government, the primary responsibility to our 
					
					children is to provide a sound education. Achieving sustainable education spending levels and 
					
					improving student achievement in Alaska should be priorities for all legislators. Finding the best 
					
					balance is a challenge that requires leaders who rise to the challenge. During times of upheaval it 
					
					is vital for State leadership to begin initiating proper reform, set sensible priorities, recognize the 
					
					multi-year impacts of decisions, and foster a more enabling environment for students, teachers, 
					
					and parents alike.  </p>
					
					<p>I believe there are workable solutions that will enhance our children’s learning achievements and 
					
					test scores while simultaneously reducing the demand on the budget. I would like to see Alaska’s 
					
					schools return to emphasizing academics rather than attitudes and social agendas. State education 
					
					policy should support parental rights in their children’s education, including freedom to choose. 
					
					It is my goal for Alaska’s schools to once again set the highest standard for education, not 
					
					measure up to the standards of others.
					</p>
			<a name="oil"></a><h3>Oil & Gas</h3>
			<p>Alaska is fortunate to be endowed with abundant natural resources, in particular enormous oil and gas reserves. Our state is also well positioned geographically to market these, and other, resources to the global marketplace. It is the responsibility of Alaska’s government to continuously review our competitiveness in critical categories related to oil and gas exploration and production compared to similarly positioned jurisdictions.</p>
 
			<p>While it is important for Alaskans to look at how fiscal realities emerge from the state’s perspective, focusing on state revenue, in order to understand the broader implications and potential risks to Alaska’s revenue stream, it is equally important that we consider the perspective of industry investors in Alaska. Most oil companies look at more than one jurisdiction when determining where they will invest, and their decision will hinge on the reasonable certainty those resources can be produced and sold at a fair profit. If we look at natural resource development from both the industry and owner perspectives, we can increase the long-term benefits current and future generations of Alaskans see.</p>
 
			<p>The Alaska State production tax is fundamentally different than all other federal and state jurisdictions in the US, in that it is a “net” tax, after most costs and expenses are subtracted from revenue. Alaska offers, by most accounts, generous incentives targeted in several ways. In addition to numerous tax credits, Alaska offers special incentives for Cook Inlet and other “non-North-Slope” oil and natural gas production, royalty modification, and natural gas storage. As we review our competitiveness, we need to focus our efforts on the aspects under the control of the State of Alaska, such as permitting, infrastructure, labor, lease costs, royalties, resource accessibility, and yes, taxation.</p>
			
			<a name="healthcare"></a><h3>Healthcare</h3>
							<p>The current operating budget is in excess of $5 billion. Nearly half of the 2015 general fund
				
				appropriation went to the state departments of Education and Health and Social Services. 
				
				Combined, they accounted for over 44% of spending in the current budget cycle. Driven by 
				
				Medicaid costs, the Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) general fund 
				
				appropriation has grown 107% in the past 10 years. 
				
				It is vital to ensure that all Alaskans have access to high quality, affordable healthcare. We must 
				
				develop and implement statewide comprehensive health and education programs in order to 
				
				responsibly address the complex systemic issues facing our population. All patients need to be 
				
				informed about the risks, costs, and benefits of all medical treatments, major and minor alike. 
				
				Patients and providers must be able to make the best decisions possible to encourage good health

				and general welfare.</p>
				
				<p>Alaska faces critical shortages of health care professionals in both urban and rural areas. Current 
				
				private medical insurance options available for purchase are extremely limited and costly. As a 
				
				result, many Alaskans continue to be uninsured. Access to basic medical care is a fundamental 
				
				necessity, one each member of our community deserve regardless of personal circumstance. 
				
				Medicaid expansion would bring coverage to tens of thousands of eligible Alaskans, and would 
				
				bring security to many families concerned about the future. </p>
				
				<p>However, the current framework underlying the Alaskan healthcare industry is in desperate need 
				
				of radical overhaul. The Medicaid system requires immediate reform to stave off collapse. 
				
				Patients and providers alike are plagued by flaws in the funding mechanisms intended to support 
				
				the financial side of the health care industry. Improvements to current standards will serve to 
				
				mitigate errors and contain escalating expenses. The introduction of managed care, increased 
				
				travel regulation and oversight, standardizing reimbursement rates, and a gradual introduction of 
				
				copays can all go a long way in finding a sustainable path forward.  Other innovations, such as 
				
				telemedicine and wellness programs, are an invaluable tool through which we can make 
				
				healthcare both less expensive and more accessible.</p>
