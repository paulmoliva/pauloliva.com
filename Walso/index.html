			<p>
				Growing up I was taught that you should always leave something better than you found it. This is my home; my family and I have been proud Alaskans for five generations. I have been an involved citizen and actively advocated for many issues within our community. Now, more than ever, we need elected officials who put the needs and values of our neighborhood first, who bring those values to government, and who are accountable to the people first, not special interests.

				On the Issues
			</h2>
			<p>
				The election of a legislature in 2016 may well be the most important decision Alaska will make during the rest of the decade. Our future as a state is at stake. We cannot condone any longer the perpetual budget gridlock, rampant mismanagement of public funds, and the loss of confidence that so defines recent political conflicts. We must stop the decline of leadership, reverse any weakening of our communal security, and put an end to aimlessly drifting from crisis to crisis.</p> 
			<p>	The Alaska Constitution states, “All political power is inherent in the people. All government originates with the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the people as a whole.” The people of Alaska have a long history of coming together to achieve great things. Our government needs to reflect this principle. We can solve our problems. We can do it with Alaska determination, spirit, and strength of purpose. But we must have leadership that listens to the Alaskan people. We must have a legislature that has the needs of all Alaskans in mind, looking to the future of our neighborhoods. Alaskans don’t expect government to solve every issue. But they do know that when times are tough we must work together; Alaska can move forward only when we do so together. The responsibility of putting Alaska on the path to sustained growth and security remains a task we all share equally. </p>
